Objective
The objective of the "Student grade calculator" program is to calculate the total marks, average percentage, and grade of a student based on the marks obtained in multiple subjects.
It allows users to input a student's name, the number of subjects, and the marks for each subject, and then displays the student's total marks, average percentage, and corresponding grade.


Program Functions
1.Constructor Student(String name, int[] marks):
   Initializes a Student object with a name and an array of marks.
   Calculates the total marks, average percentage, and grade.

2.calculateTotalMarks():
   Calculates the total marks by summing up the marks in all subjects.

3.CalculateAveragePercentage():
    Calculates the average percentage of the student based on the total marks and the number of subjects.

4.CalculateGrade():
    Determines the grade based on the average percentage:
    A: 90% and above
    B: 80% to 89%
    C: 70% to 79%
    D: 60% to 69%
    F: Below 60%

5.DisplayResults():
    Displays the student's report including name, total marks, average percentage, and grade.

6.Main(String[] args):
    Entry point of the program.
    Takes input from the user for student's name, number of subjects, and marks for each subject.
    Ensures that the input is valid (non-empty name, marks between 0 and 100).
    Creates a Student object with the input data.
    Displays the student's report using the displayResults() method.


Flow of the Program
1.The program starts by taking input for the student's name and the number of subjects.
2.For each subject, the program takes input for the marks, ensuring they are valid (between 0 and 100).
3.A Student object is created with the provided name and marks.
4.The total marks, average percentage, and grade are calculated within the Student object.
5.The program then displays the student's report including name, total marks, average percentage, and grade.
