Hi This is rohit singh.
I have completed my task in java programming internship at codsoft.

Task-2: Student grade calculator

This Java program, Student.java, is a student grade calculator based on Object-Oriented Programming principles.
It prompts the user for a student's name, the number of subjects, and the marks obtained in each subject.
The program then calculates the total marks, average percentage, and assigns a grade ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F') based on the average percentage. 
Input validation ensures a non-empty name and valid marks. It utilizes Java arrays, enums, and streams for efficient computation.
Exception handling is implemented for error-free execution. The displayResults() method presents the
student's report with their name, total marks, average percentage, and grade. 
This program offers a simple and effective way to calculate and evaluate a student's academic performance.


Used concept in java:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
The program uses OOP principles with the Student class to encapsulate student data and behavior.

Exception Handling:
Input validation is implemented using exception handling to ensure that the student's name is not empty.

Java Arrays:
The program uses arrays to store the marks obtained in each subject.

Java Enum:
An enum Grade is defined to represent the grades ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F').

Java Streams:
Java streams are used to calculate the total marks obtained.
