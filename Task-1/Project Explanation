Objective: The project aims to create a simple Number Guessing Game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated
number within a specified range.

Features:

1.Initialization: The NumberGame class is initialized with parameters such as the minimum and maximum range of the numbers to be guessed, 
and the maximum number of attempts allowed.

2.Game Loop: The game operates in a loop that allows the player to play multiple rounds if desired. 
The loop continues until the player chooses not to play again.

3.Random Number Generation: Within each round, a random number is generated using the generateRandomNumber() method. 
This number is kept secret from the player.

4.Guess Input: The player is prompted to input their guess using the getValidGuess() method. 
The input is validated to ensure it is within the specified range.

5.Guess Comparison: The player's guess is compared to the randomly generated number.
Feedback is provided to the player if the guess is too low or too high.

6.Scoring: The player's score is calculated based on the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number. 
A lower number of attempts results in a higher score.

7.Play Again: After each round, the player is asked if they want to play again.
Their total score and the number of rounds played are displayed at the end of the game.


Java Topics Covered:

1.Object-Oriented Programming: The project is structured using classes (NumberGame) and objects to model the game.

2.User Input with Scanner: The Scanner class is used to get input from the player during the game.

3.Random Number Generation with Random: The Random class is used to generate random numbers for the player to guess.

4.Error Handling with try-catch: Exceptions such as NumberFormatException and IllegalArgumentException are handled to
ensure proper input validation.

5.Loop Control: The game flow is controlled using while loops to allow for multiple rounds and limited attempts.

6.Basic Arithmetic Operations: The player's score is calculated based on the number of attempts taken.


Game Flow:
The game starts by welcoming the player and displaying the range of numbers they need to guess.
The player is prompted to enter their guess.
The game checks if the guess is correct, too low, or too high.
Feedback is provided to the player, and the number of attempts is tracked.
Steps 2-4 are repeated until the player guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.
At the end of each round, the player's score is updated based on their performance.
The player is asked if they want to play again, and the total rounds played and final score are displayed when they finish playing.
